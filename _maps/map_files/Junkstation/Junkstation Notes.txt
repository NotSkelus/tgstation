=======MISC=======
-One of the loot shuttles in arrivals with the 1 vacuum gap
 should be fixable (computer) and powered (pacman or something) to charlie-station Z-level.
-No AI minisat, 


=======Command=======
-Suffers from a tragic lack of lighting fixtures
	-The ones which are installed are broken.
-Who put all these banana peels, soap, and space lube here?


=======Security=======
-No tasers
-They get lots of crowbars and stun batons
-Easily accessible room of ED-209s and Beepskys for superior law enforcement.
	-This also means a single officer or warden can do a lot of work.
		-This is good, since anons seem to hate playing security.
-Prison has to be micromanaged by warden.
-Execution disposal should be (one of) the only deep-space facing disposals.
-Security needs a permabrig with activities
-Security should be armed with lethal weapons instead of tasers.
	-Get zaers to port the hold-up mechanics.


=======Medical=======
-The only cryo is showers
-Chemistry has cheap lighters for chem heaters (or microwave???)
-Chemistry has one pile of dirt to grow ~p~l~a~n~t~s~ drugs.
-Possibly adding drums of various base chemicals instead of chem-dispenser
	-Stops chemshitters from making 30 second black powder maxcaps.
	-Needs engineering or science to make them a dispenser
-Surgery is ROBUST
	-Has organ/limb synthesizer machine
	-Has to beg chemistry for synthflesh
	-This is now Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory
	-No prosthetics machine, use the flesh.
-Genetics has MANY boxes of monkey cubes for making surgery victims/revive-bodies.
-NO CLONING MACHINE! Surgery is ignored except for meme augs/surgeries because of this.
	-Science or Engineering can just build one if they really need it.
	-Add paper note about the "Lazarus Procedure"
		1) Copy genetics of dead guy to a monkey, humanizing it.
		2) Scoop the human brain, then monkey
		3) Human brain in new body, acting quickly
		4) Defibrillate completed human, reviving them
	-Pretty sure you can use the procedure on husks, but they won't look the same.
-Medical should have blood and gibs on the floors, and no mop-bot.
	-If anything, have an emagged mop-bot in a closet that adds more blood.
-Genetics and Virology share a pool of test subjects.
-Virology isn't airlocked, still has a shower and sink in an anteroom, though.


=======Cargo=======
-Powered by one (or more) big PACMAN generator(s).
	-Mining can bring plasma for this.
	-Quartermaster has a shotgun (beanbag?) to open emitter crates.
		-Everything spirals out of control from here. PLAY SECURITY!
	-Quartmaster has a stunprod	
	-Quartermaster office doesn't have a working door, climb through the window.
	-Boxed mules can be unboxed for delivery.
	-Something else that troubles cargo should be added. Maybe only half the doors work.
	-Allow cargo to go full ancap/cargonia in power distribution.
		-Recquiring all recreation departments to swear allegiance/pay rent.
	-Mining shouldn't start out with KA's
		-Shitters can meme plasma cutters so fast by dual wielding KA's
		  that it ruins the comfy.


=======Recreation=======
-Contains bar, dorms, janitor, botany, library, law-office, chapel, kitchen, and clown
-maybe throw in a gym, too.
-Shares power from cargo. Yes, the whole thing. 
	-Cargo will demand engineering give them power.
-Botany is surrounded by carp spawns but protected by a multi-layered window
	-Middle layer is shock grilles, but it probably won't hold forever.
	-On the plus side, renewable source of carpotoxin.
-Botany should have some cows or something, and a comfy shed.
-Botany has dirt piles instead of trays and the turf is grass.
-Janitor gets a space suit to clean up outside trash.
-Clown gets an airhorn, and some other pranks as I find them.
-Kitchen is actually inside of the large restroom. Includes toilets and showers.
	-Table with icky food
	-Morgue disposal should shoot into a receptacle for the "kitchen"


=======Science=======
-Robotics only has ghetto surgery tools
-Xenobiology has fewer slime cages (3-4)
-Xenobiology has AYY LMAO dissection room
	-Complete with some neurotoxin supply for safe handling.
		-Includes smoke dispenser so you can neuro-smoke them.
	-Possibly starts with 1-2 eggs
		-Feasible since lavaland usually seems to have a nest.
		-Admins can bully people who abuse eggs.
		-Only RD can open the shutters anyway.
	-Deads will come back just to get gassed and surgerized
		>the first transexual ayy
		-Also there's just a chance in general that they'll escape.
-Xenobiology also has only ghetto surgery tools.
-Science has everything made out of wood.
	-If there is no mining:
		>cry
		>dismantle station
-Science has supermatter shard and associated chamber to power itself
	-3 rad collectors, beg engineering for more you pleb.
-Consider including a holo-projector for the toxins bomb-test site. Experiment with cameras.
-Telescience should exist
	-Contains the teleporter normally in command
	-Contains some quantum pads
	-Contains bluespace launch pad
-Remember to add nanites room
-TOXINS WILL BE ROBUST



=======Engineering=======
-Everyone is retarded and doesn't know how to set up supermatter
	-Probably have tesla instead
	-Science is already doing mini-supermatter anyway.
-Swap to fusion/miniature sun if I ever code it.
	-Miniature sun does not move.
	-Miniature sun explicitly cannot eat reinforced floors.
		-Everything else is fair game, though.
	-Sun size is determined by total pressure of gases on center tile.
	-Sun continuously spits out oxygen & plasma which needs to be siphoned out
	-Sun continuously ignites nearby tiles. This often includes people.
	-Looking at a small sun can blind you for a while.
	-Looking at a medium sun will permanently blind you.
	-Looking at a large sun may burn your eyes out.
-waaaaah everyone should suck engineering's tit for power why all departments have powerr??!1!
	-Engineers are eternally lazy.
	-Engineers have patchwork to do already.
